FreeCAD Workbench for working on imported Meshes
The work bench has a number of features to help working with imported .stl models. This uses the functionality used within the Mesh Design workbench to help the user to scale and modify meshes.

The ability to convert an imperial mesh/meshes to Metric and vis versus.

Scale mesh down 50% and up 50%.

Scale mesh a set factor.

Scale Mesh to fit a 3D printer bed size.

Generate a STL box the szie of the printer bed for reference.

Convert a mesh/meshes to a solid.

Make an object transparent.

Make an objects transparancy Solid.

Hide an object.

Show an object.

Change a group of objects to a random colour.

Change colours of objects to 11 Colours.

Change the line width to 2.0

Show the bounding box of a Stl mesh.

Define the printer bed size.

Define the size of the object to be scaled from.

Define the Scale factor for the mesh to be scaled, 0.5 = 50% scale 2.0 = 200% scale.


How to install into FreeCAD, download the data into a directory called Meshtools and then move this directory to the relevent location based on the system you are using refer to https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Installing_more_workbenches for a manual install for working with FreeCAD
